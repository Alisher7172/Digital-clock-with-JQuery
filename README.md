## Features
- Live updating digital clock
- Simple, responsive layout with CSS
- Built with jQuery for DOM manipulation and timing

## Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (jQuery)

Files of interest:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling
- script.js — clock logic

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Alisher7172/Digital-clock-with-JQuery.git

2. Open locally
   - Double-click index.html, or
   - Serve with a simple server (recommended when experimenting with extensions):
     - Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
     - Node (http-server): npx http-server

3. Visit http://localhost:8000 (if using a local server) to see the clock.

## Customization ideas
- Change colors and fonts in styles.css
- Add 12/24-hour toggle or AM/PM indicator in script.js
- Add seconds/ milliseconds, timezone support, or animated transitions
- Add keyboard accessibility or screen-reader labels
